# KanBot

**A visual control room for your coding-agent TUIs — and a Kanban board where every card is a task run by them.**

You run a lot of terminal coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, …). KanBot gives you
one screen to *see what every session is doing*, pick any of them back up, and
drop new tasks that agents run for you — with live logs streamed straight to the
card.

Two things in one board:

1. **Track your TUIs.** A background runner watches each agent's local session
   store and surfaces every session as a card: the project, the latest message,
   how many turns, how long it's been brewing, and whether it's **working right
   now**. Sessions flow by recency — working → **Running**, just-finished →
   **Done**, older → **Backlog**.
2. **Run new tasks.** Drop a card, pick an agent, and the runner executes it and
   streams stdout/stderr to the card. Or drag any tracked session into **Running**
   to resume it (`claude --resume`, `codex exec resume`).

```

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -e .      # from this repo (PyPI: kanbot, coming soon)
kanbot up             # server + local runner, opens the board at :8787
```

The board immediately fills with your recent Claude/Codex sessions. Click any one
to see its recent transcript in a terminal view and **resume** it; or hit
**+ add task** to give an agent fresh work.

Run the pieces separately (e.g. runner on another machine):

```bash
kanbot server                                   # the board / API
kanbot runner --server http://HOST:8787 --name gpu-box
```

## Tracking other agents (Hermes, OpenCode, your own…)

Claude Code and Codex are tracked out of the box. Any agent that logs
newline-delimited JSON transcripts can be added with **no code change** — point
KanBot at its store in `~/.kanbot/config.json` (a.k.a. `~/.deckhand/config.json`):

```json
{
  "discovery_sources": [
    {
      "name": "hermes",
      "label": "Hermes",
      "root": "~/.hermes/sessions",
      "pattern": "*.jsonl",
      "recursive": true,
      "fmt": "claude"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `fmt`: `"claude"` for flat records (`{type, message, cwd, timestamp}`) or
  `"codex"` for payload-nested records (`{payload: {role, content, cwd}}`).
- `kanbot agents` shows which trackers are active and where they read from.

## Run agents

`kanbot agents` lists the CLIs detected on this machine. Built-in catalog:

| agent | run | resume |
|-------|-----|--------|
| `claude` | `claude -p "<prompt>"` | `claude --resume <id> -p "<prompt>"` |
| `codex` | `codex exec --full-auto "<prompt>"` | `codex exec resume <id> "<prompt>"` |
| `gemini` | `gemini -y -p "<prompt>"` | — |
| `glm` | Claude Code w/ `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic` | ✓ |
| `opencode`, `aider`, `cursor-agent`, `hermes`, `shell` | see `deckhand/agents.py` | — |

Override or add any agent's command in `~/.kanbot/config.json` →
`agent_overrides`. A card set to `auto` runs on whatever the matched runner has.

> Note: built-in run commands use auto-approve flags so tasks run unattended.
> Review `deckhand/agents.py` and dial them back if you want a human in the loop.

## Tags & insights

Tags are colored labels; a tag can also be an **insight provider** (◆) that pulls
live context onto any card: **git** (branch/diff), **files** (recent changes), or
a **custom command** (e.g. `pytest -q`).

## CLI

```
kanbot up         server + local runner (best first run)
kanbot server     board / API only
kanbot runner     background runner only  (--server, --name, --concurrency)
kanbot agents     detected agents + active session trackers
kanbot config     server URL, token, runner name, enable/disable agents
kanbot open       open the board
```

Config: `~/.deckhand/config.json` · data: `~/.deckhand/deckhand.db`.
Set `DECKHAND_TOKEN` on the server to require a matching `--token` from runners.
