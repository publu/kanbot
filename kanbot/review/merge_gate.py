"""Merge-blocker gate — parallel `.ai()` pass over scored findings.

A separate lens from severity. Severity asks "how bad is this issue?".
The merge gate asks "must this be fixed BEFORE the PR ships, or can it
ship and be addressed in a follow-up?". A pedantic `critical` finding
(e.g. a wrong test mock signature in unreachable code) can still be
non-blocking. A subtle `important` regression on a hot path can be
blocking.

Production goal: keep automated review useful without forcing a
REQUEST_CHANGES gate on every alarmist finding. Only true must-fix
issues should block merge. Everything else stays as advisory comments.

Architecture:
- One `.ai()` per finding, fired in parallel (mirror of polish.py).
- Failure mode: default to `blocking=False`. False negatives (a real
  blocker passes through as advisory) are recoverable by human review.
  False positives (advisory issue flagged blocking) erode trust and
  block merge — worse outcome.
