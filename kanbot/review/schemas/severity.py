"""Canonical finding-severity vocabulary — the single source of truth.

Review findings must use exactly one of four severities. Downstream consumers
(scoring, emoji lookup, by-severity counting, merge-gate) all assume this exact
set, so a model-emitted label like ``"high"`` that slips through unnormalized can
silently break a whole review.

To keep the model honest *and* the pipeline robust we do two things with this
module:

1. Type finding-severity fields as :data:`Severity` (an ``Annotated`` ``Literal``)
   so the JSON schema handed to the model advertises the enum, **and** so a
   :func:`normalize_severity` ``BeforeValidator`` coerces stray values
   (``high`` → ``important``) instead of failing validation — deterministic and
   cheap, with no retry storms or dropped-findings fallout.
2. Re-apply :func:`normalize_severity` at any serialization boundary as defense
   in depth, so a finding constructed off the validated path can never break.
